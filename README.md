## Project descreption
- Author: Andy Cui
- Build: May 16, 2012
- Phone version: Nokia 5233
- Feature: 
    ☆ Accelerated boot-up by disabling default start-up information, contacts, call logs, and other program files at boot time, optimizing boot speed
☆ Modified theme elements to Samsung phone theme elements (as shown in the figure), the four shortcut keys at the bottom were changed from left to right as follows: Phone》Contacts》Messages》Menu
    <span style="color:red">P.S: The official firmware of Nokia 5233 has only two shortcut keys: Phone and Contacts</span>
☆ Optimized phone memory to prevent lagging issues
☆ Optimized phone permissions and cracked certificate implantation
☆ Optimized audio and video decoding
☆ Optimized cache storage scheme, changed all cache files to be stored in the memory card to reduce the consumption of phone memory
☆ Changed the animations and sounds of boot-up and shutdown. The boot-up animation is approximately as shown in the picture, and the shutdown is similar
☆ Changed the screen switching effect (extracted from 5800W, but the effect is not very noticeable
☆ Inserted my own name in the version verification, and changed the system name to windows xy phone (My name is Cui Xiangyu, so I named the system "xy phone". The name was inspired by the powerful Microsoft system XP.)
☆ Injected an empty Notepad, the function has not been tested yet, according to the concept of programming it should be able to reduce the number of enumerations, but no significant effect has been seen so far……
